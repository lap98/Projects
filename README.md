## Robot Odometry

![scout_robot_image](resources/images/scout2.png)

[Scout 2.0](https://www.agilex.ai/index/product/id/2) is an indoor and outdoor mobile platform, dedicated to the development of multiple applications in higher education, research and industry.

In this project we are given some recorded data about the robot: speed of the 4 motors, odometry provided by the manufacturer and the ground truth pose of the robot acquired with [OptiTrack](https://www.optitrack.com/applications/robotics).

Using Robot Operating System (ROS) we have pursued are the following goals:
- compute odometry using skid steering approximated kinematics;
- use dynamic reconfigure to select between integration methods (Euler/Runge-Kutta);
- write 2 services to reset the odometry to (0,0,0) or to a certain pose (x,y,Î¸)
- publish a custom message with odometry value and type of integration.

## Robot Localization

[Scout 2.0](https://www.agilex.ai/index/product/id/2) is an indoor and outdoor mobile platform, dedicated to the development of multiple applications in higher education, research and industry.

In this project we are given some recorded data, such as the odometry provided by the manufacturer and other data from the following robot sensors:
- *OptiTrack* tracking system, which publishes the pose of the robot in the `/Robot_1/pose` topic;
- *SICK LMS100* lidar, which publishes the laser data in the `/scan` topic;
- *Intel T265* camera, which publishes the visual odometry in the `/camera/odom/sample` topic and the IMU data in the `/camera/accel/sample` and `/camera/gyro/sample` topics;
- *Pixhawk mini* IMU, which publishes the IMU data in the `/mavros/imu/data_raw`.

Using Robot Operating System (ROS) we have pursued are the following goals:
- create of a map from the recorded data above;
- fuse different data sources using *robot_localization* package;
- localize the robot using *amcl* package and *robot_localization* package.
